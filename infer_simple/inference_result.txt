banker loses sexism claim a former executive at the london offices of merrill lynch has lost her £ 7.5 m ( $ 14.6 m ) sex discrimination case against the us investment bank .
an employment tribunal dismissed stephanie villalba s allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay .
but the 42 - year - old won her claim of unfair dismissal resulting from her sacking in august 2003 .
her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about £ 55 000 a tiny fraction of what she asked for .
the extent of damages will be assessed in the new year .
the action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the uk - had been viewed as something of a test case .
the tribunal decided that ms villalba had been unfairly dismissed because having been removed from a senior post she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation .
ms villalba the former head of merrill s private client business in europe has made no decision on whether to appeal .
a spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as very disappointing but pointed to some criticism of merrill s procedures within the lengthy judgement .
the tribunal upheld ms villalba s claim of victimisation on certain specific issues including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract but said it found no evidence of laddish culture at the bank .
we said from the start that this case was about performance not gender merrill said in a statement .
ms villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman .
merrill lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work .
based in london s financial district ms villalba worked for merrill s global private client business in europe investing funds for some of merrill s most important customers .
but in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company and she was made redundant .
merrill lynch denied ms villalba s claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent .
the firm had told the tribunal that ms villalba s division had been losing about $ 1m a week .
merrill said ms villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit .

card fraudsters targeting web new safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments an anti-fraud agency has said .
anti-fraud consultancy retail decisions says card - not - present fraud where goods are paid for online or by phone has risen since the start of 2005 .
the introduction of chip and pin cards has tightened security for transactions on the high street .
but the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack retail decisions said .
the introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number instead of a signature .
retail decisions chief executive carl clump told the bbc that there was no doubt that chip and pin would reduce card fraud in the card - present environment .
however it is important to monitor what happens in the card - not - present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet mail order telephone order and interactive tv he said .
we have seen a 22 % uplift in card - not - present fraud here in the uk ... since the start of the year .
fraud doesn t just disappear it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain he said .
retail decisions survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system but that banks performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy at best .
the main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need said mr clump .
nearly two thirds - 65 % - of the 1 000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments .
of these 83 % were happy with the experience though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number .
however only 34 % said they had received replacement cards with the necessary chip technology from all their card providers .
furthermore 16 % said that none of their cards had been replaced while 30 % said only some had .
uk shoppers spent £ 5.3 bn on plastic cards in 2003 the last full year for which figures are available from the association of payment clearing services ( apacs ) .
altogether card scams on uk - issued cards totalled £ 402.4 m in 2003 .
card - not - present fraud rose an annual 6 % to £ 116.4 m making it the biggest category even then .
within this internet fraud totalled £ 43m apacs figures show .

uk risks breaking golden rule the uk government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its golden rule a report suggests .
the rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest and not to finance its spending projects .
the national institute of economic and social research ( niesr ) claims that taxes need to rise by about £ 10bn if state finances are to be put in order .
the treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008 .
according to niesr if the government s current economic cycle runs until march 2006 then it is unlikely the golden rule will be met .
should the cycle end a year earlier then the chances improve to 50/50 .
either way fiscal tightening is needed niesr said .
the report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections .
earlier this month accountancy firm ernst & young said that chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown s forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic .
it claimed revenues were likely to be £ 6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts .
a treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims saying it was on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond .
spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable .
other than its warning on possible tax hikes the niesr report was optimistic about the state of the uk and global economy .
it said the recent record - busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion saying that if anything the world economy will continue to grow strongly .
global gross domestic product ( gdp ) is tipped to be 4.1 % this year dipping to 4 % in 2005 before picking up again to 4.2 % in 2006 .
the us will continue to drive expansion until 2006 albeit at a slightly slower rate as will be the case in japan .
hinting at better times for uk exporters niesr said the euro zone is expected to pick up speed .
growth in britain also is set to accelerate it forecast .
despite weak growth in the third quarter the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006 niesr said adding that the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery .
gdp is expected at 3.2 % in 2004 and 2.8 % in both 2005 and 2006 .
the main cloud on the horizon niesr said was the uk s much analysed and fretted over property market .
