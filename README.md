# KoBERTSEG: Local Context Based Topic Segmentation Using KoBERT

This is an official code for **\<KoBERTSEG: Local Context Based Topic Segmentation Using KoBERT, JKIIE, 2022>.**<br>

## KoBERTSEG

### Highlights
KoBERTSEG is a KoBERT based model for topic segmentation, which has its main objective in splitting a document into sub-documents each having only one single topic.

Our main contributions are as follows:

* KoBERTSEG uses the structure used for document summarization, BERTSUM, which is able to embed per-sentence representation for give document input, and as a result can calculate relationships between each sentence which is critical for topic segmentation.

* By taking advantage of long-sequence understanding ability of KoBERTSEG, it reduces False Positive error by margin compared to other methods, which is critical for down-stream tasks such as document summarization, document classification, etc.

* Not only introducing the strcuture to be used for topic segmentation, we introduce a novel way of using a huge Korean dataset, which was originally constructed for summarization, for topic segmentation. By exploiting such a way of making dataset and training on it, we could train a model that can be generalized for news articles covering a wide range.

### Requirements
Linux, Python>=3.8, PyTorch>=1.7.1

We recommend you to use Anaconda to create a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n kobertseg python=3.7 pip
conda install pytorch=1.7.1 cudatoolkit=9.2 -c pytorch
```

### Simple Inference
With trained model at `your/dir/to/model.pth` and demo text file at `./simple_inference/demo.story`, implement simple inference using the command below;
```bash
python simple_inference.py --test_from your_dir_to_model.pth
```
This command will produce inference_result.txt file under the directory `./simple_inference`. It produces logit score for topic segmentation for each space between every two sentences.
